You can use Java 8 streams and the ExecutorService to efficiently group a list of employees by their department. Here's an example that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Employee {
    private String name;
    private String department;

    public Employee(String name, String department) {
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{" +
                "name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", department='" + department + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}

public class EmployeeGroupingExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
                new Employee("John", "HR"),
                new Employee("Jane", "Engineering"),
                new Employee("Doe", "HR"),
                new Employee("Alice", "Engineering"),
                new Employee("Bob", "Sales"),
                new Employee("Charlie", "Sales")
        );

        // Using Java 8 streams and ExecutorService to group employees by department concurrently

        int parallelism = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(parallelism);

        try {
            Map<String, List<Employee>> departmentMap = employees.parallelStream()
                    .collect(Collectors.groupingByConcurrent(Employee::getDepartment,
                            ConcurrentHashMap::new,
                            Collectors.toList()));

            System.out.println("Employees grouped by department:");
            departmentMap.forEach((department, employeeList) -> {
                System.out.println(department + ": " + employeeList);
            });
        } finally {
            executorService.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Employee` class represents an employee with a name and a department.
- The `EmployeeGroupingExample` class contains the main method where we create a list of employees and then use Java 8 streams and the `groupingByConcurrent` collector to group employees by their department concurrently.

Note: This example uses `groupingByConcurrent` to achieve concurrency during the grouping operation. The `ConcurrentHashMap` is used as the map implementation to support concurrent updates. Also, an `ExecutorService` is used for parallel stream processing.

Adjust the `Employee` class and the list of employees as needed for your specific use case.
